Glitter - A shader collection for Löve2D
========================================

This is a collection of shaders for Löve2D. The goal of the project is to have multiple often-used shaders readily available.
Note: The shader code is Löve specific, but can easily be ported to other engines.

All of the code is freely available and released under the WTFPL license. The images used for the examples are not part of that - see the License.txt for detail.

Examples
--------

All shaders come with an example. To try out the sample, make sure Löve (version 0.9.0 and up) is installed, then navigate to this folder and run:

    love .	(on Unix)
	C:\Program/ Files\Love\Love.exe . 	(or similar on Win)


Contributing
-------------

As mentioned above, the goal is to have many shaders available for free here. I will add more in the future, but please feel free to add your own!
Ideally, each shader should come with an example of how to use it.
